# tool_complexity
Trying to forecast how much will it take to run bioinformatics tools

## Add new tools to the yaml file 

## Use mytool class

If you want to know how much will it take to run a fastp:
call mytool class
```
myfastp = mytool("fastp")
```

Add variables asked by mytool class
```
myfastp.PE_reads = 0

myfastp.SE_reads = 1000000
```
Use time_complexity() and memory_complexity() to evaluate the time and memory it will take to run you tool with these params.

```
print(myfastp.time_complexity())
print(myfastp.memory_complexity())
```
